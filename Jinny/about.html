                              <p>Hi everyone! I wanted to introduce myself and thank you for following along with me on my new adventure! My name is Derek Barney and I’m the owner, operator and sole employee of A Way Back Counseling. I’m a clinical mental health counselor and I specialize in working with teens, kids and addiction. And while I specialize in those, that doesn’t stop me from helping anyone that needs it.
                                </p><p>
                                For the past 15 years I’ve been working in the mental health field. Right now, my day job is as a therapist at Sunrise Residential Treatment Center and the 8 years before that my wife and I worked as Family Teachers for Alpine Academy in northern Utah. I love helping families and I’m thankful for a job that allows me to do that.
                                </p><p>
                                A long time ago, I had a close therapist friend who saved my life, took me under his wing, and allowed me to do trade for therapy because I couldn’t afford it. I decided that when I was able to open my own practice, I would pay it forward. So that’s where you come in. I know that therapy’s expensive and many times you need it desperately, but can’t afford to pay for it. So for circumstances like that, I have a pay what you can program. You pay what you can and later on down the line, pay it forward to someone else that needs it. We’re all here together and I’m here to help you get back to where you want to be.
